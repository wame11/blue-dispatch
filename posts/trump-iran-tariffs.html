        Why President Trump’s 25 Percent Tariff Could Break the Iranian Regime and Pressure Its Allies
      </h1>

      <div class="max-w-none leading-relaxed text-[#06142b]">
        <p class="mb-6">President Donald Trump has announced a major escalation in economic pressure on Iran by imposing a 25 percent tariff on all countries that continue to trade with the Iranian regime. This move is justified by Iran’s violent treatment of protesters and its continued destabilising behaviour. The policy has the potential to bankrupt Iran and create serious consequences for countries such as China and Russia.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-6">Iran’s economy is already extremely weak. Years of sanctions, corruption, and poor leadership have caused high inflation, a collapsing currency, and widespread poverty. Ordinary Iranians are suffering while the regime spends money on weapons, nuclear development, and foreign militias. By targeting not only Iran but also any country that trades with it, the United States is cutting Iran off from the global economy almost entirely.</p>

        <p class="mb-6">Most countries cannot afford to lose access to the American market. Faced with a choice between trading with Iran or avoiding heavy US tariffs, many governments and companies will quietly step away from Iran. Banks will refuse to process payments, insurers will avoid covering shipments, and investment will dry up. This will drastically reduce Iran’s oil income, which is the main source of funding for the regime. Without that money, Iran will struggle to pay its security forces or maintain control at home.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">China and Russia’s Position</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">China is particularly affected by this policy. It buys large amounts of Iranian oil, often at discounted prices. This helps support China’s economy and energy needs. However, if China continues this trade, it risks having its exports to the United States hit with a 25 percent tariff. As a result, China may be forced to reduce its reliance on Iranian oil, further weakening Iran’s position.</p>

        <p class="mb-6">Russia is also impacted, although in a different way. Iran is an important strategic partner for Moscow in the Middle East. A collapsing Iranian economy would reduce Iran’s usefulness to Russia and increase instability in the region. At the same time, disruptions to oil exports can cause uncertainty in global energy markets, which may hurt Russian revenues and long term planning.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Necessary and Justified Action</h2>
        <p class="mb-6">In my view, this policy is both necessary and justified. The Iranian regime has repeatedly shown that it does not respond to diplomacy or weak statements. Protesters are beaten and killed, Israel is constantly threatened, and terrorism continues to be funded. Strong economic pressure is one of the few tools that can genuinely weaken the regime.</p>

        <p class="mb-6">However, economic pressure alone may not be enough. If Iran continues to attack its own people, advance its nuclear programme, or threaten Israel, there should be even stronger action. That includes the possibility of targeted strikes on military and nuclear facilities. Strength, not hesitation, is what deters dangerous regimes.</p>

        <p class="mb-6">This is why I support President Trump’s approach and why I am proudly pro Israel. Israel faces an existential threat from Iran, and half measures have failed for decades. By forcing the world to stop doing business with a brutal regime, this policy applies real pressure and brings the possibility of real change closer.</p>
